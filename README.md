## Glossary
<strong>Branch</strong>: This allows users to work in a separate space from the rest of the project. It's useful for more experimental features and divergencies in what you are working on. Branches can be merged together into the main project, or made off of other branches to spread out even further. Users can move from branch to branch to neatly separate their tasks and statuses of the project
<br><strong>Clone</strong>:
<br><strong>Commit</strong>: once you get something working, you can "commit" to your work, and give it a message to describe what you did. This will effectively save your work so you can return to it if needed.
<br><strong>Fetch</strong>:
<br><strong>Git</strong>:
<br><strong>Github</strong>:
<br><strong>Merge</strong>:
<br><strong>Merge Conflict</strong>: This occurs when the content that you are attempting to merge and the preexisting code are different and git cannot figure out which change you would like to keep.
<br><strong>Push</strong>: This is typically done when you end your session of working. It takes all of the commits you have done and "pushes" it to the repository, which updates the repository with all the work that you pushed.
<br><strong>Pull</strong>:
<br><strong>Remote</strong>:
<br><strong>Repository</strong>: A repository is where all of the project is held. Any device can see the project from here, and from here they can also clone the project to their own local device to work.
